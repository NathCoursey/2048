# 2048 
Browser based 2048 game with a neutral and earthy aesthetic. Simply slide the squares to combine matching numbers.
To win the game, keep combining the numbers until you reach a sum of 2048. You will be unable to proceed forward once the board is left with no space and unmatching numbers.

**Directions**
1. Use your arrow keys to move the numbers around.                                                                   2. Combine matching numbers to get their sum.
3. Avoid collecting too many twos if you want to stay in the game longer.  4. Fit the biggest numbers together in one spot.
5. When you combine numbers your score will also increase.
6. If you reached the number 2048 and won but wish to keep playing, just
    press the "new game" button at the top.
7. If it's game over and wish to keep playing restart by pressing the "new game" button at the top.

## **Next Steps**
I'd like to implemenent more features like personal best score, and animations for the winner and loser status. I encountered some issues
I'd like to fix with the game over function. I would still like to 
keep it as minimal as possible to make it unique.
